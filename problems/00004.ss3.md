## 문제
uppose that there is an infinite set of gangsters, one for each positive integer.

For each gangster, they have a contract out on exactly one of the others.

Also for each gangster, there is exactly one of the others that has a contract out on them.

Is there necessarily some infinite subset of these gangsters, none of whose members has a contract out on another?


## 정답
Here's a simpler procedure to find an infinite safe set, which doesn't involve Ramsey theory or the axiom of choice.

We start with gangster 1, and put them in the chosen set. The gangster that 1 has a contract on, and the gangster that has a contract on 1, are both put in the eliminated set.

Now we add the lowest-numbered uneliminated gangster to the chosen set and repeat. We keep doing so forever.

We can't run out of uneliminated gangsters, as the number of eliminated gangsters is never more than twice the number of chosen gangsters.

So we end up with an infinite set of chosen gangsters, none of whom have a contract out on each other.
